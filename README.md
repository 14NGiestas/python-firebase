# Python Firebase

The python interface to the Firebase's REST API.

## Installation

    $ git clone git@github.com:ozgur/python-firebase.git
    $ python setup.py install

## Getting Started

You can fetch any of your data in JSON format by appending '.json' to the end of the URL your data resides in and then send an HTTPS request through your browser. Like all other REST specific APIs, Firebase offers client to update(PATCH, PUT), create(POST), or remove(DELETE) the stored data along with just fetching it.
